# CRWHooks

A lightweight MediaWiki extension that routes user registration notifications to a dedicated Discord webhook when used alongside [mw-discord](https://github.com/jayktaylor/mw-discord).
This extension also serves as the home for additional custom hooks developed for the Consumer Rights Wiki, which will be added over time.
